## Undergraduate Research and Careers

- Undergraduate research refers to mentored research that undergraduate students participate in conducting. Students participate in research to contribute to advance the field as well as gain experience to progress in their academic or professional career.
- The correlation between undergraduate research to academic and professional career progression, the data from the study about how "Undergraduate Research Experiences Broaden Diversity in the Scientific Workforce" sought to analyze the correlation.

## STUDY #1 :Research Participation 


**Does participating in any mentored research (low- or high-intensity) raise the probability of:** 

::: {.fragments}
-  accepting a place in a science graduate programs
-  entering a STEM career
:::

**Is there a difference in results for low-intensity versus high-intensity experiences?**

## Explanation of data: Study #1

- Study by Oxford University: *"Undergraduate research experiences broaden diversity in the scientific workforce"*

- **Variables Explored:**

::: {.fragments}
- `MRL_1d`: 1 semester, low-intensity research  
- `MRL_2d`: 2 semesters, low-intensity research  
- `MRH_1d`: 1 semester, high-intensity research  
- `MRH_2d`: 2 semesters, high-intensity research  
- `SciGradAccept`: Accepted into a science grad program  
- `STEM_Career`: Currently in a STEM career

## RESEARCH INTENSITY vs GRADUATE PROGRAM ACCEPTANCE 

```{r}
#| fig.alt: "Heat map displaying the proportion of different research durations and intensities that got accepted into Science Grad Programs. High intensity research, regardless of duration (1 or 2 semesters) has equal proportion of acceptance into grad programs (37%). Low intensity research for 1 semester had the lowest proportion of acceptance into grad programs (28%), while low intensity research for 2 semesters had the highest proportion of acceptance into grad programs (43%). This indicates that higher intensity and duration of undergraduate research increases the likelihood of acceptance into science graduate programs."

In all graphs, there is a higher number of students in non-STEM careers compared to STEM careers, regardless of research intensity or duration. In the graphs for both high and low intensity research, the increase in duration of research increased the proportion of students who went into STEM careers compared to non-STEM careers.

## CONCLUSION
-	From the visualizations created through this study, we observed that overall, longer research seems to be correlated to a greater rate of students pursuing a future STEM career and being accepted into graduate school for their career.
- As for our second question, we found that the difference between outcomes of low-intensity and high-intensity was too varied to be conclusive of any trends, and as such concluded that the duration of research had the biggest impact.



## STUDY #2: SOIL SCIENCE

- **Does participating in any mentored research (low- or high-intensity) raise the probability of: Does constitutional support increase the probability of availability of specialized programs in Universities?**

::: {.fragments}
-	Institutional support: Land Grants
-	Specialized Program: Soil Sciences 
:::

- **Is there a difference in results for institutions with vs. without land grant status?**

## Explanation of data: Study #2
-	Data collected by Soil Science Society of America Journal 
-	Dataset name: "Data on universities offering undergraduate degrees that train students for soil science careers at universities in the USA and its territories"
-	Variables explored:
-	(Land Grant) - Indicates whether the institution is a land-grant university
-	(Soil Science) - Indicates if the institution offers soil science


## LAND GRANT vs SOIL SCIENCE OPPERTUNITIES

    title = "Institutions with Land Grant Status was Twice as likely to have Soil Science Opportunities",

```

## CONCLUSION 
- From this second study, we concluded that availability of land grants was positively related to the proportion of available opportunities for certain STEM programs (specifically Soil Science in this case)
-	This means that institutions with land grants (and thus more funding) were able to provide more resources for students in the program
